Key Features:

Developed a machine learning model to classify medical images as cancerous or non-cancerous.
Focused on detecting oral cancer using image data, ensuring high accuracy and reliability.
Challenges:

Limited availability of labeled datasets for training.
Mitigating the risk of false negatives (missed diagnoses) to avoid critical errors in medical applications.
Techniques/Technologies:

Model: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) built using TensorFlow/Keras.
Data Handling: Preprocessing images through resizing, normalization, and augmentation to improve the robustness of the model.
Evaluation Metrics: Precision, recall, and F1-score to emphasize the reduction of false negatives.
Outcome:

Achieved high classification accuracy on the testing dataset.
Model proved effective in detecting oral cancer in early stages from medical imagery.
